<h2>Background</h2>

Based on your BMI number, you can use the BMI-classification shown in the following table, to get an indication of you weight class. 

<table id="scoretable">
    <caption>Table 1: BMI Classification for Adults. From <cite>LEX <a href="https://denstoredanske.lex.dk/body_mass_index">lex.dk</a></cite> </caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> BMI range </th><th>Weight Class</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr> 
            <td>&lt;18.5  </td><td>under-weight</td>
        </tr>
         <tr> 
            <td>&lt;18.5-25  </td><td>normal-weight</td>
         </tr>
         <tr> 
            <td>&lt;25-30  </td><td>over-weight</td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td>&gt; 30  </td><td>obese</td>
          </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Remark, that can use this BMI classification for adults, both men and women. It does not apply to children and teenagers because the BMI scale here depends
on age and sex. </p>

<p>Also beware that the BMI method has <a href="https://iform.dk/vaegttab/hvad-betyder-dit-bmi-tal#BMI-ulemper"> limitations </a> and that 
    <a href="#alternative_methods">other methods </a> exist. </p>

<h2>Calculation Method</h2>

     see <a href="#bmi-formula"> Equation 1</a>.</p>
